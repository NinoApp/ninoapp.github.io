## Nino is not OCR
Note taking amounts to an important part of studying materials for many students, be
they grade school or graduate students. In many cases, there are no lecture notes or slides
readily available, or the ones that are available do not cover all of the lecture content. This
requires students to take notes during the lecture.

However, in some cases, the student has to note down the words fast without truly
processing their content, or write down equations without having the time to analyze and
thus understand them. In the case of writing down sentences, one can achieve faster note
taking with tablets/computers [1] but when the lecture notes consist of plots, graphs or
mathematical equations, our market research shows that there is no hardware/software
help to achieve faster note taking than writing it down [2].

In some cases, scribing all the things written on the board (even without making sense
of it) proves to be quite hard, therefore many note taking strategies have arisen [3]. Many
of these strategies revolve around the rule that one first takes notes of keywords, and
then rewrites the notes after class [3]. However, there are two possible problems with this
strategy: the student might forget the information conveyed via that particular keyword,
or might miss important information and not write a keyword about it.
